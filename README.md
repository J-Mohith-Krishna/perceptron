# Perceptron
## Description
The above given file named "main.py" consists of the perceptron model which consists of a minimal neural network. This file is written in the Python programming language and its goal is to implement a basic python model.
## Explanation:
    Importing necessary functions:
      -We have used the python function in the creating of this program.
    Classes:
      -We have created a Class function namely Perceptron and gives object as the parameters.
      -Then we have created four objects.
    Output:
      -This program produces an array of numbers as outputs which are the result of successfully running the perceptron.
